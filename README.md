# scrapmill

This tiny module can be used for scraping data from financial websites in real time.

The current setup contains an example that scrapes data every 10 seconds for a financial derivative **MINI L TESLA AVA 28** from an investment bank in Sweden called Avanza and saves it in *.csv* format.

If you want to try it out, just download the module and run it using *Python*.

```bash
python scrapmill.py
```
